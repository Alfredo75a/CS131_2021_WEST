# Info
My understanding of this project is to study a specific intrest related to this course, apply that priciple to solve a problem, then present. We can use this page to upload our work. In order to keep things organized I would suggest creating your own folder for a specific topic and working with others in that directory(folder) if you want to work on that topic. I invite anyone who has worked with github before to assist if you know best practices when it comes to colaboration. 

# Project Information
In our most recent lecture Professor Yuen went over some more details for this project. Broke it down into two sections
    1. Find a topic. I can be anything, bitcoin is just one idea. It just has somehow relate to this course. It does not need prior aproval but you can run it past him if you like. 
    2. We have to create a 5-7 min presentation that covers the topic and how it relates to ideas covered in this class. We can upload a video to youtube or share a private link to the Professor if we don't want it to be public. We can work together if we like.
